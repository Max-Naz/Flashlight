# Flashlight
Mobile application "Flashlight" for Android.
Uses the camera flash (native mode) and the screen (additional mode) as a flashlight.
The app has settings that allow you to: include a flashlight automatically at startup, do not turn off the flashlight when working with other applications and with the screen off, turn on/off sound button.
The application is implemented using the material design concepts, as well as vector graphics, in consequence of that application takes not a lot of space on the device in comparison with analogues.
The application also has an intuitive interface, pleasant to use at night.
The next version is planned to add the widget and the ability to control the screen brightness when using the front light mode from the screen.
